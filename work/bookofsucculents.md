## A fun book about the basics of succulent care.

In recent years, succulents have become increasingly popular for their low-maintenance use as indoor decoration and in home gardening. However, it can be very daunting for first-time succulent enthusiasts — myself included — to learn all the know-how for giving their new friends their best care. Over the last few months, I have been looking into tips, tricks, and basic care guides to take care of my own succulent pals. I took the opportunity to archive these newfound knowledge into a small, easy-to-read book.

From general plants identification, to watering and propagating, combined with fun, colorful and aesthetic illustrations and photos, The Little Book of Succulents will be your best companion and all you need to start on your succulents adventure.
