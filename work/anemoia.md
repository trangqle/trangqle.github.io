## “We chose the word ‘anemoia’ because it reflects what we wants to bring to the world - a nostalgia of a faraway past.”

Anemoia is an embodiment of the revival of vintage aesthetics. Founded by two woman with a deep interest in Victorian literature and history, Anemoia wants to capture the beauty of this era through fashion that is casual and accessible.

We settled on an earthy and vintage color palette, a set of serif typefaces, Tiempos Fine and Cormorant Garamond (Italic), and a complementary sans-serif, Raleway. The soft, muted tones of the palette and the delicate typefaces defines their characteristics, while staying true to the brand's values.
