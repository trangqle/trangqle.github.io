## Located at the center of Hanoi, surrounded by busy streets and numerous office buildings, Noodles by Hien is a restaurant specializing in all kinds of noodles and soups. They aim to provide their main clientele of young professionals with the freshest ingredients and the fastest services.

Under a 3-month internship with Vinotek, I had the opportunity to work on the rebranding of Noodles by Hien. The goal of the rebranding was to better reflect their target customers and to separate them from nearby competitors. To achieve this, we developed a branding system that utilized thick strokes, geometric shapes, and bold primary colors.
