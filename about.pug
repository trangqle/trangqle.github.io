            p(class="font-size:m typeface:freight") Using a pragmatic approach with a strong emphasis on research, I create visual systems that enhance brand values and deepen connections to people. My works go beyond any specific style, but not without a touch of feminity and modern minimalism. I always look forward to learning new things and facing new challenges.
