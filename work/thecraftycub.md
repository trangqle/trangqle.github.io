## The Crafty Cub is a local toymaker and toy shop that specialized in woodworking and knitting. With the pandemic going on, they want to create an online presence so that they can continue bringing happiness to every kids, one toy at a time.

It started with creating a simple branding identity that is fun and memorable, with a bright and warm color scheme and a funky logotype. Afterwards, their website's concept is developed, with a focus on simplicity in navigation - users never have to frustratingly dig into the website to find what they need.
