## Mya (mai-a) is a fashion label that focuses on silk products. They aim to blend high-fashion with everyday wear, and commits to only using sustainable and ethical sources.

Mya's branding is developed with their values at its core. The logotype is created using a customized modern serif typeface, giving it a sense of luxurious and elegance that are associated with silk, with an italicized Y as a stress syllable and for visual interest. The flower mark are made from water droplet symbols, which represents their commitment to be a sustainable and eco-friendly label.
