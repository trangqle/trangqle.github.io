## The Wild Bloom Co. focuses on organic herbal tea blends. They aims to deliver an authentic and quality tea experience &mdash; by only choosing the finest, 100% locally sourced ingredients for their blends.

Staying close to the brand's values and aesthetic &mdash; refined, delicate, organic and authentic, a vintage-inspired custom logotype, icon, and monogram were developed for the business. The letter W and B were modified with a softer curves, influenced by the flow of tea. Their packaging uses a set of stylized floral illustrations with a soft pastel color pallete, giving them more character while keeping the minimalistic look.
